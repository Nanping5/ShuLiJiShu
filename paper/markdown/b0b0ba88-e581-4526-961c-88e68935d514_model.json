By employing a verified OpenFOAM-based CFD simulation framework, lift and drag coefficients were determined at a Reynolds number of \\(10^{5}\\). Considering the limited availability of data on low Reynolds number airfoils, this dataset is invaluable for a wide range of applications, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and wind turbines. Additionally, the study offers a method for automating CFD simulations that could be applied to obtain aerodynamic coefficients at higher Reynolds numbers. The breadth of this dataset also supports the enhancement and creation of machine learning (ML) models, further advancing research into the aerodynamics of airfoils and lifting surfaces."

These include symmetric, asymmetric, cambered, and reflex airfoils, which further enhance the scope of the framework developed. The '.dat' files were downloaded from the UIUC Airfoil Data Site using a Python script developed by Josh [33], and those from the Airfoil Tools site were downloaded manually. The '.dat' files thus obtained were of varying numbers of points, and hence, this was a major consideration during the automation of the Class Shape Transformation (CST) process. The study exclusively utilized '.dat' files in the Selig format. In this format, the coordinate system begins at \\((1,0)\\), advances to the leading edge, and then returns to \\((1,0)\\) via the lower surface of the airfoil."

Notably, when the leading edge point deviated from the origin (0,0) with a y-offset, the airfoils generated through the CST method exhibited a marked increase in error percentage. This deviation significantly altered the airfoil's curvature, rendering it beyond the capture capability of the 'blockMesh' utility. Additionally, a significant portion of the airfoils had their trailing edges positioned away from (1,0), challenging the meshing process, which necessitates a trailing edge at (1,0). Consequently, airfoils not meeting this criterion were excluded from the preliminary airfoil database. The comparison between the original and the derived airfoils showed only a minimal error margin (less than \\(5\\%\\) margin of error). This is elucidated in Figure 2. The original airfoil is given by the blue line, and the dashed line represents the airfoil profile generated using the CST framework. This approach was developed utilizing MATLAB® R2022b building on the work of Pramudita Satria Palar [35]."

For flow over an airfoil, laminar flow eventually transitions to turbulent flow at the transition point (generally at \\(30\\%\\) of the airfoil chord). However, during turbulence modeling, any of the selected turbulence models, which will have to capture the overall flow phenomena over the airfoil, will not account for the small laminar portion of the flow, and will rather assume fully turbulent flow, which can produce certain inherent biases in the generated data set, especially for the drag outcomes. Considering all of these, for the given flow conditions (incompressible, low-speed, low-Reynolds number) and the nature of simulations (external airfoil 2D flow), the Spalart-Allmaras (SA) single-equation model was deemed to be the most appropriate amongst the other turbulence models. In order to verify the fidelity of the results, apart from validation with published experimental data of other investigators, which the SA model had good agreement with over a wide range of angles of attack, parameters such as the \\(y^{+}\\) were considered. The \\(y^{+}\\) is a non-dimensional distance used to determine the proper size of the cells near domain walls during turbulence modeling. Given that the average \\(y^{+}\\) during most of our simulations was approximately 0.13, the Spalart-Allmaras model appears more than adequate for generating reliable high-fidelity data. The only limitation associated with the SA model is its inability to accurately predict drag outcomes in highly separated flow regions, such as at high angles of attack."

The airfoil '.dat' file obtained from the online airfoil repositories was initially imported into MATLAB®. Following this, the Selig format '.dat' files were split into the coordinates of the upper and lower surfaces of the airfoil. The CST method using the shape and class functions was run individually on both the upper and lower surfaces. Thus, the CST coefficients of the airfoil were obtained. In order to increase the number of points in the '.dat' file to 600 points, the obtained coefficients were substituted in an eighth-order Bernstein polynomial. Regardless of the number of points in the initial '.dat' file, the CST framework generated the CST coefficients and a '.dat' file with 600 points. The number of points in the '.dat' file was standardized to be 600 (Section 2.3), which was crucial to the subsequent meshing process. This is elucidated visually in Figure 8."

In most CFD simulations, property residuals of the order of around \\(10^{-5}\\) are considered to be well converged, while residuals around \\(10^{-6}\\) are considered tightly converged (no further variation in the value of the property with further iterations). Tests across multiple airfoil shapes and angles of attack indicated that 2000 iterations consistently produced residuals of the order less than \\(10^{-5}\\) across all properties, including \\(U_{x}\\) (x-direction fluid velocity), P (local pressure) and the turbulence parameters. The \\(U_{x}\\) and \\(U_{y}\\) initial residuals plot for the simulation of NACA 0018 at \\(0^{\\circ}\\) is shown in Figure 9. It can be inferred that beyond 1500 iterations, there is no substantial change in the residuals (almost a near-converged solution). Moreover, beyond 2000 iterations, the lift and drag coefficients only varied in the 4th and 6th decimal places, respectively, which have negligible contributions to the measured parameters. Furthermore, increasing the iteration count would significantly raise computational time and resources. Therefore, in the process of automating the simulations, the iteration limit for each airfoil was set to 2000."

As the angle of attack reaches its limits, leading to detached flows, simulation results tend to deviate from those reported in the literature. This deviation is challenging to address without resorting to unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) or Large Eddy Simulation (LES) techniques and the use of highly detailed meshes [41]. Previous studies, including this one, have noted inconsistencies in the numerical versus experimental lift \\((C_l)\\) and drag \\((C_d)\\) coefficients across angles of attack (AoA) when employing the Spalart-Allmaras model [42]."

In the preliminary stages, the slight discrepancy in the drag coefficients at high angles of attack will not cause significant issues and will be more than adequate for initial estimates. This represents an alternative application for the generated dataset and serves as a much more comprehensive and accurate substitute instead of depending on crude panel solvers for initial estimates."

In order to remain within their limits of safe operation, these UAVs only fly at moderate Angles of attack, rarely exceeding \\(7^{\\circ} - 8^{\\circ}\\), within which the aerodynamic predictions and results remain reasonably accurate. Moreover, beyond the selected range of angles of attack, extreme flow separation will initiate airfoil stalling characteristics. Given the diversity of airfoil shapes present in the dataset, the absolute stall angles will also vary considerably for each airfoil, and hence be extremely difficult to predict and standardize. This is another reason why a moderate angle of attack range (from \\(-4^{\\circ}\\) to \\(8^{\\circ}\\)) was selected."
